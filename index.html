            <p>Our experience from years of working in countries around the world has shown us that supporting
                voluntary, non-remunerated donation is the most effective and cost-efficient intervention. We have
                resourced collectors by providing items such as donation
                couches, portable beds, and recognition gifts to enhance comfort and encourage donors to return.
